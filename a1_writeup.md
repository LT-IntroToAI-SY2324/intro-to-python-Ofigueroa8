# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
Python feels incredibly different to me and it messes with my muscle memory. I was so used to doing things a certain way and I felt like I could solve any problem but I constantly have to look back to the Python notes or rely on ChatGPT to tell me how to do something or how something works. It feels a bit frustrating, but I know that learning Python will be beneficial in the long run by adding another language to my reportoire.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Some differences between Python and Java are that the ';' are not placed on the majority of lines, some characters are missing from Python that make writing code shorter (ex: if statements don't have parenthesis in Python, variables are just defined with the name first without writing 'String' or 'int', the print statement isn't "System.out.println"). The similarities between both languages just lie within the fact that certain lines of codes still do similar things, they're just written differently.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
The assignment 'a1.py' really helped me learn more about the way Python is written to become more comfortable. I still find myself looking back on the notes or ChatGPT on how to write certain things, but overall I am getting used to how Python is written. I thought it would take a lot longer but the code segments make more sense to me. I've also relearned pretty quickly how to problem solve. I tend to brainstorm a lot of ideas that I think can work when solving some of the problems in 'a1.py' to choose the best combination.
